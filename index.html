        <p>
        Here we are gonna talk about the netflix serie called Black mirror, in this web page we will answer some questions.
            
       <srtong> Should we have an opinion, a belief or knowledge about limits of technology? Why? </strong>
            
            A knowledge because if we dont technology could take advance of you like in the chapter
            called Nosedive if you dont know in wich stratum you move you could finish in jail or very bad 
            so you need what to do, we also know that it is mostly like a monopoly.
                  </p>
            <p>
            Do you think that technology improves or inhibits our knowledge tools and skills? Why?
            
            We think that it inhibits it becasuse you will never have a true friendship all you
                are gonna have are many people interest of their stars and in having someone to trust,
                like we saw on Nosedive chapter.
        </p>

        <p>
            We selected that picture because we undestand it like if technology now is balanced with us but in some
            time when it start to gain more force it will defeat us beacuse humans need food and some rest to be 
            able to done activities while machines only need a little of energy like sun to do the same activities
            like us but fastter and with less resourses.
                  </p>
