       <srtong> Should we have an opinion, a belief or knowledge about limits of technology? Why? </strong>
            
            A knowledge because with out it we could make with it some bad things to us or others changing completly its original objetive.
                  </p>
            <p>
            Do you think that technology improves or inhibits our knowledge tools and skills? Why?
            
            We think that it improves it because if you need or want to know something you can serch for it on internet,
            but it also inhibits you because when there was no internet you needed to investigy for it trying different things.
